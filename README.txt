This is the continuation of SpawnMob for Bukkit that was originally made/developed by Deven Lahoti (xmlns).
Version 4 and later barely uses any code from the original plugin.

Changelog
Version 4 (Clean Slate)
COMMANDS ARE CHANGED IN THIS VERSION!
As you can see this is a new repository and this is the fist commit, the reason for this is that version 4 barely uses any code from the original version made by xmlns.
That's why this is the "Clean Slate" version.
Now for the changes and new features.
New Features:
Horses
Spawn on player works fully again
Mobs riding things works again
Spawning on coordinates
Better command structure

Bug Fixes:
Fixed spawn on player and spawn riding bugs
Fixed ocelot killing bugs
Fixed ocelot spawning bugs
Fixed a heck ton of bugs
